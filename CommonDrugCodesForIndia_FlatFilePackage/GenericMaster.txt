Hypersensitivity to hyaluronidase or any other ingredient in the formulation is a contraindication to theuse of this product.	When hyaluronidase is added to a local anesthetic agent, it hastens the onset of analgesia and tends to reduce the swelling caused by local infiltration, but the wider spread of the local anesthetic solution increases its absorption; this shortens its duration of action and tends to increase the incidence of systemic reaction.

MAO inhibitors impair the metabolism of serotonin, and concurrent administration increases serum levels of serotonin. One must have 14 days of the MAOI-free period to reduce the risk of serotonin syndrome before initiating treatment with trazodone. Concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs, such as triptans, TCA, or fentanyl, will also increase serotonin levels.

Methylprednisolone contraindications include patients with documented hypersensitivity to the drug or components, systemic fungal infection, intrathecal administration, live or attenuated virus vaccine, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, or in premature infants.	Methylprednisolone is a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) substrate and is mainly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity generally decrease hepatic clearance and increase the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrate medications, such as methylprednisolone. In the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose of methylprednisolone may need to be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity generally increase hepatic clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of medications that are substrates for CYP3A4. Coadministration may require an increase in methylprednisolone dosage to achieve the desired result. In the presence of another CYP3A4 substrate, the hepatic clearance of methylprednisolone may be affected, with corresponding dosage adjustments required. It is possible that adverse events associated with the use of either drug alone may be more likely to occur with co-administration.	Schedule H

Furosemide is particularly useful when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired.Furosemide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in acute pulmonary edema. The intravenous administration of furosemide is indicated when a rapid onset of diuresis is desired, e.g., in acute pulmonary edema.If gastrointestinal absorption is impaired or oral medication is not practical for any reason, furosemide is indicated by the intravenous or intramuscular route. Parenteral use should be replaced with oral furosemide as soon as practical.	Furosemide is contraindicated in patients with anuria and in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to furosemide.	Furosemide may increase the ototoxic potential of aminoglycoside antibiotics, especially in the presence of impaired renal function. Except in life-threatening situations, avoid the combination. Furosemide should not be used concomitantly with ethacrynic acid because of the possibility of ototoxicity. There is a risk of ototoxic effects if cisplatin and furosemide are given concomitantly. In addition, nephrotoxicity of nephrotoxic drugs such as cisplatin may be enhanced if furosemide is not given in lower doses and with positive fluid balance when used to achieve forced diuresis during cisplatin treatment.

327384009	Exemestane 25 mg oral tablet	387017005	26643006	421026006	Antineoplastic agent+Aromatase inhibitor-containing product	This medication is used to treat certain types of breast cancer (such as hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer) in women after menopause. Exemestane is also used to help prevent the cancer from returning. Some breast cancers are made to grow faster by a natural hormone called estrogen.	Contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug. In pre-menopausal women and in pregnant or lactating women	In vitro evidence showed that the drug is metabolised through cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 and aldoketoreductases and does not inhibit any of the major CYP isoenzymes. In a clinical pharmacokinetic study, the specific inhibition of CYP3A4 by ketoconazole showed no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of exemestane. In an interaction study with rifampicin, a potent CYP450 inducer, at a dose of 600 mg daily and a single dose of exemestane 25 mg, the AUC of exemestane was reduced by 54% and Cmax by 41%. Since the clinical relevance of this interaction has not been evaluated, the co-administration of medicinal products, such as rifampicin, anticonvulsants (e.g., phenytoin and carbamazepine) and herbal preparations containing hypericum perforatum (St John’s Wort) known to induce CYP3A4 may reduce the efficacy of exemestane. Exemestane should be used cautiously with medicinal products that are metabolised via CYP3A4 and have a narrow therapeutic window. There is no clinical experience of the concomitant use of exemestane with other anticancer medicines. Exemestane should not be co-administered with oestrogen-containing medicines as these would negate its pharmacological action.	Schedule H

Methylprednisolone contraindications include patients with documented hypersensitivity to the drug or components, systemic fungal infection, intrathecal administration, live or attenuated virus vaccine, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, or in premature infants.	Methylprednisolone is a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) substrate and is mainly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity generally decrease hepatic clearance and increase the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrate medications, such as methylprednisolone. In the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose of methylprednisolone may need to be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity generally increase hepatic clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of medications that are substrates for CYP3A4. Coadministration may require an increase in methylprednisolone dosage to achieve the desired result. In the presence of another CYP3A4 substrate, the hepatic clearance of methylprednisolone may be affected, with corresponding dosage adjustments required. It is possible that adverse events associated with the use of either drug alone may be more likely to occur with co-administration.	Schedule H

703907006	Apixaban 2.5 mg oral tablet	698090000	26643006	421026006	Coagulation factor Xa inhibitor-containing product	Prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery. Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), including those with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); age ?75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ?II). Compared to warfarin, apixaban also results in less bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adult patients.	Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk. Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.	Coadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban Cmax. The use of apixaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). Active substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., amiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to increase apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required when coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For example, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, single dose), an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an inhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. Coadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an approximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant use of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, however in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. Apixaban is not recommended for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be compromised. Due to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is contraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), an additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. Naproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No changes were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and no clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of apixaban and naproxen. Despite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response when antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Apixaban should be used with caution when coadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding risk. There is limited experience of coadministration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As such agents increase the bleeding risk, coadministration of these medicinal products with apixaban is not recommended. In vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 and weak inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP2C19 at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma concentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a concentration up to 20 µM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered medicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of P-gp. Administration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure.

Irinotecan is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to the drug or its excipients	Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 are metabolised via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). Coadministration of irinotecan with inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or UGT1A1 (eg. Ketoconazole, Atazanavir sulfate, etc.) may result in increased systemic exposure to irinotecan and the active metabolite SN-38. Concomitant administration of CYP3A-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin) leads to reduced exposure to SN-38. Interaction between irinotecan and neuromuscular blocking agents cannot be ruled out. Since irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity, drugs with anticholinesterase activity may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of non-depolarising drugs may be antagonised. The adverse effects of irinotecan, such as myelosuppression and diarrhea, would be expected to be exacerbated by other antineoplastic agents having similar adverse effects. Lymphocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving irinotecan, and it is possible that the administration of dexamethasone as antiemetic prophylaxis may have enhanced the likelihood of lymphocytopenia. Hyperglycemia has been observed in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus or evidence of glucose intolerance prior to administration of irinotecan. It is probable that dexamethasone, given as antiemetic prophylaxis, contributed to hyperglycemia in some patients. Laxative use during therapy with irinotecan is expected to worsen the incidence or severity of diarrhea. Dehydration secondary to vomiting and/or diarrhea may be induced by irinotecan. The physician may wish to withhold diuretics during dosing with irinotecan and during periods of active vomiting or diarrhea. Patients who develop severe diarrhea, leukopenia, or neutropenia with the bevacizumab and irinotecan in combination should have irinotecan dose modifications.	Schedule H	NLEM

Contraindicated in hypersensitivity to tretinoin, retinoids and Tretinoin is teratogenic. It is contraindicated during breast-feeding.	As tretinoin is metabolised by the hepatic P450 system, there is the potential for alteration of pharmacokinetics parameters in patients administered concomitant medications that are also inducers or inhibitors of this system. Medications that generally induce hepatic P450 enzymes include rifampicin, glucocorticoids, phenobarbital and pentobarbital. Medications that generally inhibit hepatic P450 enzymes include ketoconazole, cimetidine, erythromycin, verapamil, diltiazem and ciclosporin. Increased toxicity of tretinoin (e.g. pseudotumour cerebri, hypercalcaemia) was reported when azole antifungals (e.g. fluconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole) were administered. This appears to be the result of a pharmacokinetic interaction mainly involving CYP3A4. Combination with other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors or macrolides, e.g. clarithromycin), may also trigger tretinoin toxicity. A dose reduction of tretinoin should be considered if necessary.

Famotidine is a H2 blocker (antacid). It works by reducing the amount of acid in the stomach which helps in relief of acid related indigestion and heartburn.	Famotidine is contraindicated in any patient hypersensitive to the drug or its components. Famotidine should be used cautiously in patients with hepatic disease, renal impairment or renal failure (renal disease), because the drug can accumulate, causing toxicity. There is a close relationship between the drug's elimination half-life and creatinine clearance. Dosages of famotidine should be adjusted in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. Symptomatic response to therapy with famotidine does not preclude the presence of gastric cancer. In the patient who is self-medicating with OTC formulations, the continuation of heartburn, acid indigestion, or dyspepsia beyond 2 weeks signals the need to consult a health-care professional for evaluation. Patients using non-prescription famotidine products who have a suboptimal response or early symptomatic relapse after completing therapy should consider evaluation for gastric malignancy.				
703908001	Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet	698090000	26643006	421026006	Coagulation factor Xa inhibitor-containing product+Anticoagulant agent	Prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery. Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF), including those with one or more risk factors, such as prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA); age ?75 years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; symptomatic heart failure (NYHA Class ?II). Compared to warfarin, apixaban also results in less bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adult patients.	Hepatic disease associated with coagulopathy and clinically relevant bleeding risk. Lesion or condition if considered a significant risk factor for major bleeding. This may include current or recent gastrointestinal ulceration, presence of malignant neoplasms at high risk of bleeding, recent brain or spinal injury, recent brain, spinal or ophthalmic surgery, recent intracranial haemorrhage, known or suspected oesophageal varices, arteriovenous malformations, vascular aneurysms or major intraspinal or intracerebral vascular abnormalities. Concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulant agent e.g., unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (enoxaparin, dalteparin, etc.), heparin derivatives (fondaparinux, etc.), oral anticoagulants (warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, etc.) except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.	Coadministration of apixaban with ketoconazole (400 mg once a day), a strong inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to a 2-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban Cmax. The use of apixaban is not recommended in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, such as azole-antimycotics (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole) and HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). Active substances which are not considered strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp (e.g., amiodarone, clarithromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, naproxen, quinidine, verapamil) are expected to increase apixaban plasma concentration to a lesser extent. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required when coadministered with agents that are not strong inhibitors of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. For example, diltiazem (360 mg once a day), considered a moderate CYP3A4 and a weak P-gp inhibitor, led to a 1.4 fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and a 1.3 fold increase in Cmax. Naproxen (500 mg, single dose), an inhibitor of P-gp but not an inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Clarithromycin (500 mg, twice a day), an inhibitor of P-gp and a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, led to a 1.6-fold and 1.3-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax respectively. Coadministration of apixaban with rifampicin, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-gp, led to an approximate 54% and 42% decrease in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. The concomitant use of apixaban with other strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may also lead to reduced apixaban plasma concentrations. No dose adjustment for apixaban is required during concomitant therapy with such medicinal products, however in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp apixaban should be used with caution for the prevention of VTE in elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE. Apixaban is not recommended for the treatment of DVT and PE in patients receiving concomitant systemic treatment with strong inducers of both CYP3A4 and P-gp since efficacy may be compromised. Due to an increased bleeding risk, concomitant treatment with any other anticoagulants is contraindicated except under specific circumstances of switching anticoagulant therapy, when UFH is given at doses necessary to maintain an open central venous or arterial catheter or when UFH is given during catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. After combined administration of enoxaparin (40 mg single dose) with apixaban (5 mg single dose), an additive effect on anti-Factor Xa activity was observed. Naproxen (500 mg), an inhibitor of P-gp, led to a 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold increase in mean apixaban AUC and Cmax, respectively. Corresponding increases in clotting tests were observed for apixaban. No changes were observed in the effect of naproxen on arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation and no clinically relevant prolongation of bleeding time was observed after concomitant administration of apixaban and naproxen. Despite these findings, there may be individuals with a more pronounced pharmacodynamic response when antiplatelet agents are coadministered with apixaban. Apixaban should be used with caution when coadministered with SSRIs/SNRIs, NSAIDs, ASA and/or P2Y12 inhibitors because these medicinal products typically increase the bleeding risk. There is limited experience of coadministration with other platelet aggregation inhibitors (such as GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonists, dipyridamole, dextran or sulfinpyrazone) or thrombolytic agents. As such agents increase the bleeding risk, coadministration of these medicinal products with apixaban is not recommended. In vitro apixaban studies showed no inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 and weak inhibitory effect on the activity of CYP2C19 at concentrations that are significantly greater than peak plasma concentrations observed in patients. Apixaban did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4/5 at a concentration up to 20 µM. Therefore, apixaban is not expected to alter the metabolic clearance of coadministered medicinal products that are metabolised by these enzymes. Apixaban is not a significant inhibitor of P-gp. Administration of activated charcoal reduces apixaban exposure.

Methylprednisolone contraindications include patients with documented hypersensitivity to the drug or components, systemic fungal infection, intrathecal administration, live or attenuated virus vaccine, idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, or in premature infants.	Methylprednisolone is a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP) substrate and is mainly metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme. Drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 activity generally decrease hepatic clearance and increase the plasma concentration of CYP3A4 substrate medications, such as methylprednisolone. In the presence of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, the dose of methylprednisolone may need to be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 activity generally increase hepatic clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration of medications that are substrates for CYP3A4. Coadministration may require an increase in methylprednisolone dosage to achieve the desired result. In the presence of another CYP3A4 substrate, the hepatic clearance of methylprednisolone may be affected, with corresponding dosage adjustments required. It is possible that adverse events associated with the use of either drug alone may be more likely to occur with co-administration.	Schedule H
